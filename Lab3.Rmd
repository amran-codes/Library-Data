#Importing datasets
```{r}

library(tidyverse)

#importing my data sets

#Merged all files into one object
```{r}
#organizing my column names
common_columns <- Reduce(intersect, list(colnames(data2015),colnames(data2016),colnames(data2017)))

#combining my files data

#removing the commas in values from combined data

#removing any spaces in variable names

#removing NA's

#Creating a new column that represents operating revenue per active card holder (total operating Revenue / number of active card holders).
```{r}

#Fixing improper formatting of  values including comma's in numbers
datacombined$B2.9..Total.Operating.Revenues <- gsub(",", "", datacombined$B2.9..Total.Operating.Revenues)

datacombined$A1.14..No..of.Active.Library.Cardholders <- gsub(",", "", datacombined$A1.14..No..of.Active.Library.Cardholders)




#Identifying three key insights around this metric. These insights  follow a theme and build to my goal of providing a recommendation to your manager and sponsors on how libraries can be successful.

#Guiding questions: How can the insights that I generate stitch together to create a logical, informative and actionable story line for my audience?”


```


#Submitted R script contains  the steps necessary to produce 3 key insights from data import to data preparation and exploration (next part lab 4).
